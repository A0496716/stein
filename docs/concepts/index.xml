      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a policy? Why needs policies? Nowadays, thanks to the infiltration of the concept of &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code&amp;rdquo;, many infrastructure settings are coded in a configuration file language such as YAML.
For YAML files that we have to maintain like Kubernetes manifest files, as we continue to maintain them in the meantime, we will want to unify the writing style with policies like a style guide.</description>

      <description>Policy as code is the idea of writing code in a high-level language to manage and automate policies. By representing policies as code in text files, proven software development best practices can be adopted such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment.
Many existing policy or ACL systems do not practice policy as code. Many policies are set by clicking in a GUI, which isn&amp;rsquo;t easily repeatable nor versionable. They usually don&amp;rsquo;t provide any system for testing policies other than testing an action that would violate the policy.</description>
