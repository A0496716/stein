      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a policy? The policy describes the rule &amp;ldquo;The configuration file should be written like this&amp;rdquo;. How the configuration file should be written depends on the company and team. Stein respects and embraces the approaches adopted by Terraform and HashiCorp Sentinel so that it can be defined flexibly.
Stein can test against the configuration file based on those policies. Therefore, by combining with CI etc., you can enforce rules on the configuration file.</description>

      <description>Policy as code is the idea of writing code in a high-level language to manage and automate policies. By representing policies as code in text files, proven software development best practices can be adopted such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment.
Many existing policy or ACL systems do not practice policy as code. Many policies are set by clicking in a GUI, which isn&amp;rsquo;t easily repeatable nor versionable. They usually don&amp;rsquo;t provide any system for testing policies other than testing an action that would violate the policy.</description>
