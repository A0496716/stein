      <description>The stein apply command is used to execute a policy locally for development purposes.
Usage: stein apply [options] POLICY  This command executes the policy file at the path specified by POLICY.
The output will indicate whether the policy passed or failed. The exit code also reflects the status of the policy: 0 is pass, 1 is fail, 2 is undefined (fail, but because the result was undefined), and 2 is a runtime error.</description>

      <description>The stein fmt command formats a policy source to a canonical format.
Usage: stein fmt [options] FILE ...  This command formats all the specified policy files to a canonical format.
By default, policy files are overwritten in place. This behavior can be changed with the -write flag. If a specified FILE is - then stdin is read and the output is always written to stdout.
The command-line flags are all optional.</description>
