Stein is a command-line interface (CLI) for developing and testing policies.
Having a standard workflow to develop policies is critical for our mission of policy as code.
The CLI takes a subcommand to execute.
The complete list of subcommands is below.

The Stein CLI is a well-behaved command line application.
In erroneous cases, a non-zero exit status will be returned.
It also responds to `-h` and `--help` as you'd expect.
To view a list of the available commands at any time, just run `stein` with no arguments.
