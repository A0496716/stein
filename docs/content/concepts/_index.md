Stein is a tool like a linter for config files (such as JSON, YAML, HCL) with a customizable rule set.

As the motivation of this tool, the factor which accounts for the most of them is the [Policy as Code](docs/policy-as-code.md).

Thanks to [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), the number of cases that the configurations of its infrastructure are described as code is increasing day by day.
Then, it became necessary to set the lint or policy for the config files.
As an example: the namespace of Kubernetes to be deployed, the number of replicas of Pods, the naming convention of a namespace, etc.
