The syntax of Stein configurations is called [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). It is meant to strike a balance between human readable and editable as well as being machine-friendly. For machine-friendliness, Stein can also read JSON configurations. For general Stein configurations, however, we recommend using the HCL Stein syntax.
