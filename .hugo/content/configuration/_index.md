Stein uses text files to describe infrastructure and to set variables. These text files are called Stein Policy Configuration and end in just `.hcl`. This section talks about the format of these files as well as how they're loaded.

The format of the policy files are able to be in extended HCL (called as Stein format). The Stein format is more human-readable, supports comments, and is the generally recommended format for most Stein files. The JSON format is meant for machines to create, modify, and update, but can also be done by Stein operators if you prefer.
